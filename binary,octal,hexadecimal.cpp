/*
Binary code is the set of combination of 0 and 1 which help us deduce or write anything in computer based 
high and low voltage denoted as 1 and 0.
its base is 2. it means for example in integers, we write 230 as 2*10^2 + 3*10^1 + 0*10^0
so here, the base is 10. so for binary, for example 0110, it means 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 and it gives the value
of the binary. (number of digits for ex how many 0s and 1s, the range of integer it can go upto is 2^n-1 where n is number of digits)

for octal, the base becomes 8 and for hexadecimals the base becomes 16 and after 10, letters a b c d are used (for 10, a is used)
 for representing 15, 
    decimal- 15
    octal- 017 (a 0 behind the number is a format for octal representation) ALSO NOTE THAT IN OCTAL ONLY DIGITS 0 TO 7 CAN BE USED
    hexadecimal- 0x0f (0x before the number is the format for hexadecimal number)
